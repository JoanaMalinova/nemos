Deployed with Firebase -  https://nemos-663db.web.app
A SPA - fish and coral online store with React and Cloud Firestore as Back-End Provider. 
Firebase Authentication for user login and register.
Still in production. Authetication, validation and error handling still not optimized.
Cart , store and seacrch function.
Home page has multiple sections, which are fully functioning as well.
All roots are linked with react-router-dom.
I use react-router-dom for actions and loaders as well as route navigation.
